# Create
Create is a simple CLI for python that makes it easy to set up new python-projects. It aims to make a clean project-layout with sensible defaults, without assuming any dependecies what-so-ever. 

The CLI's API isn't decided yet. It will either stay as-is, or move towards the same API as the dotnet-CLI.

The project-layout is inspired by [this document](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/)


### Installing
For now you have to first setup the `$HOME/.my_binaries/bin`-directory and export it to your $PATH. Then you clone the project from git, cd into the cloned project and run `make install`


### Usage
To create a new project run the command:
```terminal
$ create python <project-name>
```
This will create your project at `$HOME/PythonProjects/<project-name>/`


### Contributing
All contributions are very welcome, we are all here to learn. You can: try to install and run the project, write issues or report bugs, problems or just general criticism. Any feedback is also welcome! As well as requests or suggestions for improvements. You can also tackle some of the issues that are already registered and submit pull requests. All contributions no matter how small will be credited
